## How to use
We can consider this project divided into two parts:
1. Front-end (this repo)
2. Back-end ([crowe-api](https://github.com/samuel-s-marques/crowe-api))

The front-end needs the back-end to be running in order to work.

### Requirements
Before beginning, you'll need to have installed in your machine [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Running the front-end (client)
Download this repo (you will need to extract the files), clicking [here](https://github.com/samuel-s-marques/crowe-web/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or cloning:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/samuel-s-marques/crowe-web
```

Access the project's folder in your cmd/terminal
```bash
$ cd crowe-web
```

Install the dependencies using **npm install**
```bash

The client will start on port :8080 - access [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
